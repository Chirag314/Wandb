# Wandb practice
This readme file describes a Python script analyzing the Iris dataset using various machine learning models and visualizing the results with Wandb.

Project Overview:

This project explores the Iris dataset, a classic multi-class classification task.
It trains and evaluates multiple models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.
Metrics like accuracy, F1-macro, and negative log-loss are tracked using Wandb.
Wandb also provides visualizations of decision boundaries, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
Code Breakdown:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Imports libraries like sklearn and wandb.
Loads the Iris dataset, splits it into training and testing sets.
Logs the data table to Wandb.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Defines functions for:
main(name_model, model): Trains a model, logs metrics, and visualizes classification plots.
cross_validation(model): Performs cross-validation and calculates average accuracy, F1-macro, and negative log-loss.
Trains and evaluates different models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.
Logs model performance metrics to Wandb for comparison.
Visualizations:

Utilizes wandb.sklearn.plot_classifier to generate decision boundaries, confusion matrices, and ROC curves for each model.
Allows visual exploration of model performance and decision making.
Usage Instructions:

Install wandb and run the Python script.
Wandb automatically tracks and logs all results and visualizations.
Key Takeaways:

This project demonstrates the use of Wandb for tracking and visualizing machine learning experiments.
Users can analyze the performance of different models and compare their strengths and weaknesses.
The visualizations provide insights into model decision boundaries and classification behavior.
Dependencies:

Wandb
sklearn
pandas
